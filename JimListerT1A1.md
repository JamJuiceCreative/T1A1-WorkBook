### 1. *Identify and explain common and important components and concept of web development* 

> Web development mark up language defines the method of annotating text in order to give a specific visual output through a web browser. Created in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee, Html (hyper text markup language) is the most widely used version of this and along with CSS and Javacript can be used to make beautifuly aesthetic, functional, dynamic and responsive web sites. HTML specifically utilises the use of tag elements and attributes to define the contents within the containing element's layout and structure. Tag elements are marked up using angle brackets. For example a tag with the annotation of \<body>\</body> would contain a websites body elements which would be specified within this parent element. Therfore within the body container a semantic way of presenting the content to be placed within the main section would be to utilise the tags; \<main>\</main> or navigation as \<nav></nav>as opposed to standard \<div> tags making the code more easily deciphered. These tags can then be given various different attributes like classes or id's that allow the content to be called upon by a selector and function or appear in a specific way with scripts and style sheets. One of the main funtions of a HTML document is to define the navigation of a web page. Fundamentaly hyperlinks are the backbone of navigation accross the web and a html document allows you to define them using anchor tags \<a></a> and give them functionality by assigning the href attribute. A websites internal navigation are often made up of ordered or unorderd list items within anchor tags. The image tag is an example of where from to call an image and how and where to place it within the rest of the content of the website. Like all other tags it can be assigned attributes to define how it should be called or how it should behave visually. Using \<style> tags you can style the contents of an element within a html document, for example; font-type, color, width, etc or you can use attributes to perform a method called in-line styling. It is a more common practice to style a website using css however, and html is used to simply arrange and organise the content within the specified sections or containers. A few other elements in HTML are the \<html> tag and the \<head> tag. These elements contain meta data which translates technical information about the websites to browsers and is not displayed.

### 2. *Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:*
* *packets*
* *IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)*
* *routers and routing*
* *domains and DNS*

  * __Explain__ how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.   



> What are packets? A packet is formatted piece of data sent from one system to another over a network. The data is fragmented into smaller pieces and then sent one after the other finally being combined to make up the larger overall message. This method of data transfer is to avoid causing congestion within a network where a large file would take a long time to transfer and block other files for an extended period of time. Instead the router formats the file into packet data each containing the same destination address and sends them seperatly along various flexible routes so that other information can be transfered inbetween. This formating procedure is what we refer to as the internet protocol and the approach is known as packet switching. 

> What are IP addresses? an IP address is a number used to identify a computer or a whole network of computers. IP4 is the older version (Internet Protocol Version 4) which has a smaller 32-bit address whereas IP 6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) is a 128-bit hexadecimal address making it better in terms of complexity and efficiency.

> What are routers and routing? A Router is a device that recieves information from the internet and translates it to visual elements that you'll see on your monitor. Routing is the process of sending and recieving data between the personal computer and the world wide web. This process basically concists of sending and recieving the packet data that is broken into smaller pieces and assembling it back into whole pieces of information. 

> What are domains and DNS servers? A domain is like an address that must be registerd in order for designers to publish websites and users to visit websites. Like a physical address, this is where the website lives on the internet. A DNS is a naming database where these addresses are stored and matched to their corresponding IP addresses. As the domain is like a street address, a DNS is a bit more like a street directory. This process makes the internet more user friendly allowing us to enter in addresses in a text format as opposed to a sequence of numbers. Not dissimilar to how a street directory stores addresses in an index, URL addresses are stored in a tree like data structure. Top level domains (which include .com .gov .net .org etc) sit above second level domains like google.com. Even lower, Sub-domains would concist of domains like images.google.com for example. DNS stands for domain name server.

**\*explain how each technology has contributed to the devlopment of the internet**

### 3. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
 - TCP
 - HTTP and HTTPS
 - Web Browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)

 >What is TCP? Transmission Control Protocol is a method of introducing computers to one another from all over the world in a virtual space with a focus on having no central control. In 1971 Vinton Cerf invented the protocol which was followed by "Internet Protocol" (IP) and Cerf's Protocol in the 80's. Ultimately this concept resulted in the invention of the world wide web and the internet as we know it today. TCP is the prefered method of data transfer when it's paramount that the data all arrives in one piece as opposed to a protocol like UDP (User Datagram Protocol) which is the prefered method when low-latency connections are the priority. TCP packet data is given sequential numbers, this allows the reciepient computer to re-arrange the data into the correct format. It also prevents duplicate packets arriving due to delayed checksum acknowledgment by simply deleting duplicate data. 

 >What is HTTP and HTTPS? Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the official procedure a web browser utilises to transfer files and data across from internet servers to user browsers. It's basically a set of rules governing the transfering systems over the internet. HTTPS [developed by Netscape] includes Secure Socket Layers (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) in conjuction with the HTTP. Basically what this means is that information and data being transfered is covered with an additional level of security by encrypting it for it's travels and decrypting it on it's arrival. "Secure" is the key word when thinking about HTTPS as it adds an extra level of protection when transfering data.  

 >What are Web Browsers? A browser is the visual interface that allows a user to interact with the internet through a series of client side requests and response exchanges accross internet servers as described in the aformentioned HTTP section of this question. This data is then rendered into the user interface of a website first on the server side; rendering to HTML on the server, then on the client side; rendering the user interface of the website in the browser. The first Internet Browser to utilise a graphical interface was ERWISE in 1992, followed by Mosaic in 1993 which popularised wide spread internet use. This influencial piece of tech gave rise to the more commonly known internet browsers including netscape navigator in 1993 which became the most popular web browser at the time accounting for 90% of all web useage in 1995. Finally we have our most popular browsers of today; fire-fox, safari and google chrome which inlude a vast array of features that allow us to seamlessly surf the web as well as developer tools aimed at the increasingly technology savy users and programers akin. These developer tools allow a developer to annalyze and break down a website, visualise the internal workings of websites as well as experiment with new code implimentation all within the same browsers that we use every day.

### 4. Identify THREE data structures used in the Python programming language and explain the reasons for using each.

### 7. Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue.

List of topics containing ethical issues:
 - access to a user’s personal information (medical, family, financial, personal attributes such as sexuality, religion, or beliefs)
 - intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement.
 - criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited substances, terrorism

For each ethical issue identify a source of legal information relating to the ethical issue and discuss whether the law is helpful in assisting a developer to act in an ethical way. (Word count guide: 200 words max)

Conduct research into a case study of ONE of the ethical issues you have chosen discuss how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches. (Word count guide: 400 - 600 words)

### 8. Explain control flow, using examples from the Python programming language.

### 9. Explain the difference between type coercion and type conversion. Are either of these used in python. 

### 10. Explain data types, using examples. 

### 11. Here's the problem: "There is a restaurant serving  a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?"
- Identify the classes you would use to solve the problem
- Write a short explanation of why you would use the classes you have identified. 

### 12. Identify and explain the error in the code snippet below that is preventing correct execution of the program.

```python
celsius = input()

fahrenheit = (celsius*9/5)+32

print(f"The result is: {fahrenheit}.")
```

### 13. The code snippet below looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swamps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly. 
```python
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i<arr.len() -1) and (arr[i] < arr[i+1]>):
    i += i
print(i)
    arr[i] = arr[i+1]
    arr[i+1] = arr[i]
```

### 14. Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:
1. Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations
2. Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart

### 15. Write pseudocode OR Python code for the following problem:
You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.
